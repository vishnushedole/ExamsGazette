## Technologies used
We used **React JS** for the front-end development, which allowed us to build a fast and responsive user interface. On the backend, we used **Node JS** and **Express JS**, which provided a robust and scalable server that can handle a large number of users. To store and manage the data, we used **MongoDB**, a powerful and flexible NoSQL database that allows for easy data management and retrieval.
